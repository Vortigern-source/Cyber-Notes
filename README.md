# Hack the Box Notes/Write-ups

My name is Hamza, I'm an IT student and doing hackthebox/tryhackme challenges is something I do in my freetime while also studying cyber security in general. Ive been meaning to start writeups for a long time as it helps me with notetaking and understanding the underlying principles rather than mindlessley solving and moving on.
